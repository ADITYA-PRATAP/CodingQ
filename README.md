# Next.js Website with Authentication

This is a simple Next.js website that includes user authentication functionality. It allows users to register an account, log in, and access protected routes.

## Features

- User registration: Users can create a new account by providing their email address and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
- Protected routes: Certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.
- Session management: User sessions are managed using server-side sessions to maintain user authentication state.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A statically typed programming language that adds type-checking to JavaScript.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Firebase Authentication: A service provided by Google that handles user authentication.
